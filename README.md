# YOLOv8 Fine-Tuning with RADIATE Dataset

## Overview
This project involves Tranfer learning the YOLOv8 model on the *RADIATE dataset*, which focuses on perception in adverse weather conditions. The RADIATE dataset provides various weather scenarios, including rain, snow, fog, and normal driving conditions, making it a valuable resource for training object detection models in challenging environments.
